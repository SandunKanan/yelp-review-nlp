Heaven! $.75 each and they were perfection. Cold, crisp, huge, not a speck of grit in the two dozen we had.  We're in love.  The service was expedient. Not super friendly but the oysters made up for it. I was reading an article about the best oyster happy hours and we had decided to try the Blind Pelican too. By contrast Luke is like Nordstrom and the Blind Pelican is an extra dirty Walmart.  Don't waste your time going anywhere else for raw oysters. Come here from 3-6p and enjoy!

GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,Luke,customers,"I have been to LUKE four times and this was my worst experience.  There was a hair in my Crawfish Bisque so I quietly brought it to the bartender's attention.  She quickly removed the cup of soup and came back with a manager.  This is where I became disappointed.  The manager could not look me in my eyes and she never said, ""I'm sorry"" for the haor in my food.  She stated that it never should have happened (I agree) and she hopes I will eat there again.  She told me about the three new desserts and offered to give me a complimentary dessert or a new cup of soup.  Sometimes all you need to do is say, ""I'm sorry this happened.""  I hope there's some additional training on how to talk to customers and resolve issues in a professional manner in the future.  Otherwise, I love eating here!",1,savannah,"Had been suffering from Luke withdrawal since our last trip to N.O. during JazzFest 2010.  Yes I bought John Besh's first cookbook and have enjoyed making many of the recipes - but I have been craving Luke's redfish court-boullion (Friday special) and have been nervous about tackling the recipe. 
Husband and I were recently on a chartered cruise that had a port stop in New Orleans - on a Tuesday. A few weeks prior I contacted the restaurant with a special request for the court-boullion for lunch on that day.  There was a nice email exchange with a couple of folks and the answer was a very gracious YES and I was so excited!
Our lunch that day at Luke was the absolute highlight of our wonderful but too short visit to the city. Our server Savannah was absolutely delightful - I thanked her for accommodating my special request (I don't think I've ever ordered ""off the menu"" before so this for me was a very special request). She explained that they always like to accommodate special requests ***as long as they are given ample notice*** which I think is so generous. And certainly I would never have requested the court-boullion last minute, after all, I've seen the recipe!!! Anyway we settled in and husband ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts - so delicious and imaginatively prepared. He also ordered the wiener schnitzel that he fondly remembered from previous visits - it was fork tender with a crispy yummy crust - huge portion. I ordered the crab bisque to accompany the redfish court-boullion. Am not exaggerating when I say that the bisque was the most delicious soup I have ever tasted. The court-boullion may have even been better than I remember - the flavor combination is unique and such a taste treat. We also enjoyed a unique appetizer of pate with various mustards and relishes.  Okay - then it gets even better. We ordered the bread pudding - but of course, because I remembered it to be the very best anywhere. It still is the very best anywhere. The sauce is killer - a butter rum goooooooey ooze of deliciousness with crispy sugared roasted pecans all over, with a huge scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream on top. Oh no, and we also were served a warm cherry apple strudel with salted caramel ice cream on the side.  I am salivating just remembering all this while writing.  
Needless to say, our experience went far beyond our already high expectations.  We were treated like royalty- or maybe dear family (even better) by Savannah and staff, we were thanked by the assistant manager as we left.  All in all it was an unforgettable experience and we cannot wait to return.",5,-0.477389073,0.446693385

Once inside, be prepared to feast, feast and feast!!!  The ambiance is super cute.  There is seating inside and out in a small courtyard.

I noticed that my new bowl was extremely hot and the rice was still mixed in my bowl.  I asked if she had just microwaved my dish.  She confirmed that she had.  I told her that this was unacceptable and would like a new warm serving.  She stated that it takes many hours to prepare and I would have to wait 12 hours for a fresh batch.  It was hard to tell if this had a touch of sarcasm.  I don't think a warm bowl of the ""best gumbo in NO"" is too much to ask.  She returned with another bowl and it was warm.  The dish was slightly above average compared to the non-New Orleans gumbos that I've had in my life.  And certainly not the best. I tried my dining partner's Creole Combo platter.

I was put off initially because the line was always super long and while that's a great sign, when I was extremely hungry I didn't want to spend a lot of time waiting.

I had the Chicken and Andouille sausage gumbo with a Strawberry Daiquiri. The portions (for both food and drink) were plentiful, the food extremely flavourful and filling, and the price wasn't that high either.

I would not recommend this restaurant at all and the only star is for some of the table staff.",1,place especially,"As I do whenever I travel, I received suggestions from friends and consulted Yelp for recommendations on my trip to Nola. Of course, Commander's Palace came highly recommended. After perusing the menu, I was sold. 

Commander's Palace is nestled in the Garden District amongst the gorgeous homes of Anne Rice, Millionaire's Row, and what I learned is called ""the wedding cake house."" 

My husband and I arrived and took advantage of the complimentary valet service. Once we settled inside, we were whisked away to our table for two. This place emanates class and elegance. 

We quickly decided on what we wanted. The hubs ordered a Mint Julep and myself a sparkling water. Our order was identical for the food. We opted for the three course dinner which included a soup or salad, entree and dessert. We each ordered the turtle soup (their specialty!), Black Skillet Seared Gulf Fish and the infamous Creole Bread Pudding Souffle. If I could give more than five stars I would. This meal was absolutely impeccable. The portions, flavors, freshness and presentation were amazing. We were in food heaven. 

The servers moved gracefully through the room as if they were in some choreographed waltz. I don't think I've ever had better service before. 

Finally, our bill came and we were surprised to see how reasonable this meal cost us - $135 which included 25% tip. It was well worth it. I would have gladly paid double or triple.

Lastly, I'd like to say as a ""yankee"" I can appreciate this type of restaurant. The south really knows how to put together a classy, delicious meal. I wish Chicago held ambiance like this place does. I especially appreciated the dress code. I wish more people dressed up for dinner.

_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,Commander's Palace,rude,"I was very excited to try this famous restaurant but was disappointed. 

As a visitor from NYC, I was expecting higher quality food and service for the price I paid. I went with my boyfriend for Sunday ""jazz Brunch"" during a weekend trip to New Orleans. 
All the other Yelp reviews praised the service but my server was rude and inattentive. It took a long time after we were seated to get menus, and I feel like at a top-notch establishment like this with an army of servers in black tie, that shouldn't happen.

We started with cocktails which were good - Mint Julep and Garden Fever delight (with rose' and aperol, very sweet but refreshing). For the first course I had the gumbo. I've never had gumbo before but to me it tasted like a bowl of barbecue sauce with chunks of fish in it. It was very flavorful and seasoned but it just was not an enjoyable dish for me personally.

My favorite part of the lunch was the BREAD! First you're served with garlic toast and then a hot loaf of French bread. Eat that while it's hot and fresh out of the oven! 

Next I had the pecan crusted crab over a corn sauce for my entree. This was tasty but very rich and heavy. I enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. My boyfriend got the louisiana Bayou brunch which was even richer and heavier than my dish - fried catfish, cheesy grits, and 2 poached eggs. There were 2 creamy sauces on his dish too and that just made the dish too complicated and heavy. Again, we ate it but didn't really think it was worth the fuss and price.

For dessert I was very excited about the bread pudding souffle...but the whiskey cream sauce ruined it for me! The whiskey flavor completely overpowered the lightness of the souffle and notes of bread pudding flavor. Just tasted like mushy creamy whiskey. My boyfriend ordered the dessert with bananas, cookie dough ice cream, chocolate chips, and peanuts...that was amazing. I ate almost every bite of that! 

So...if you're visiting from a city that already has nice cuisine and fine dining..don't waste your time coming here. Instead check out more casual (and affordable) local spots that still have classic Louisiana dishes.",1,fourth,"I had always wanted to visit the Commander's Palace.

The jazz trio that came through added such a great sense of fun and festivity.  And the food, wow.  Just....wow.  I started with the Shrimp and Tasso.  I cannot stomach most seafood and rarely eat shrimp.  I tried this because it was one of their signature dishes.  I understand why.  It was so perfect and delicious I could not believe it.  My companion was dying of jealousy.  For dessert, I had their famous bread pudding.  This was also everything it was reputed to be.  A perfect place, a perfect experience.

_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,Commander's Palace,dressed,"The food was okay -- but not worth the price, and utterly ruined by the service.   It is, in fact, the oft-touted service that gets the 1-star rating.   When you're dining at a place that charges this much, and has staked its reputation on providing the best service of any restaurant in New Orleans, a city famous for its amazing restaurants, the service should really be spectacular, or, at the very least, somewhat pleasant.   The service on the night my wife and I dined there (November 2nd, 2015) was neither.   Our waiter was aloof, surly, and attitudinal.  And the service of the entire staff was just odd and kind of insulting.   First off, they totally botched the ritual of providing appropriate colored linen napkins at the point of the seating.   They gave me a black napkin and then left the white napkin sitting on my plate!   I took it off myself, and it just sat there on the table, a wadded up napkin, for the rest of our dinner.   When I asked our waiter about some things on the menu, he stood behind me, basically, and directed all his answers to  my wife -- without even once looking in my direction, with this twinkling sneer in his eyes -- so that I had to crane my head around awkwardly to face him.   You get better service than that at a diner!    The table next to us all received a round of amuse bouche appetizers.   I noticed a few tables that had received these.   Not us.   Even after we'd place our orders.   At another table near us, the chef came out with an entire round of some other complimentary appetizer.   The message I got through this uneven/imbalanced service is that some customers are valued more than others -- perhaps ones who dine there often and/or appear to have money & power?   (Though I will mention that my wife and I were both dressed nicely and that we often dine in upscale restaurants.)    I thought that the fact that we were friends with one of the dining room captains might have given us a leg up in this snooty environment, but apparently I was wrong.   Incidentally, the best item on the menu that we sampled that night were the raw oysters.   The pecan-encrusted drum was okay, but nothing special.   And the salads were ridiculous -- basically, just a 3-inch-in-diameter mound of about 4 lettuce leaves.   They were tasty, but this cost 9 dollars a piece!    I realize that most of the reviews of this restaurant give it 5 and 4 stars.   But my wife & I did not have a 4/5-star experience.   And in fact the whole experience left a really bad taste in our mouths.

My girlfriend and I visited for Jazz Brunch and it was a memorable experience. The restaurant staff professionally took care of our every need and the jazz band was a nice touch to the relaxing atmosphere. The food was amazing! I had the Turtle Soup, the Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish, and the Creole Bread Pudding Souffle. This was the first time I had ever had turtle soup; it was rich and tasted very similar to a fresh beef stew. The small pieces of turtle meat were flavorful and tender. The fish was perfectly flakey and covered in a nice crispy pecan crust. The corn sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly sweet, a very nice compliment to the fish. This was also the first time I had ever tried Bread Pudding and the perfect way the end the meal. The pudding was flavorful, lightly creamy and lightly sweet. The flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg were perfect and not overpowering. Overall, this was one of the best dining experience I have ever had.

I wish I had requested to be seated upstairs with a balcony view, but it wasn't a big deal. Something I'll remember to do the next time I return! We were seated immediately upon arrival and since the table was already given to us, did not want to have to inconvenience the restaurant with the request.

Suggest asking for Tina as your waitress if possible! She was funny and entertaining with her southern sass, one of the best servers I've had in a while. It isn't often that I'll rate a review as 5 stars, but honestly there was nothing lacking in service, environment or food that night.

Food Highlights:
+Chargrilled Oysters: Concierge at the hotel I stayed at mentioned Royal House has the best chargrilled oysters in NOLA. While I cannot attest to that, I definitely could see how it is ranked as such. Fresh warm oysters topped with parmesan butter cheese, great starter to open up the stomach.
+Crab Claws: I already had my eyes set on this dish after reading reviews and seeing pictures. It exceed my expectations as I didn't know what to expect. The lemon garlic butter sauce reminds of a crab bisque consistency, but the real winner here is the crab claws themselves! These tiny succulent crab claws really soaked up the flavor of the sauce, could not get enough of them! Highly recommend this appetizer!
+Blackened Redfish (w/ Crabmeat): Tina recommended saving some of the crab claw sauce to place on top of the redfish. This was a tip she provided since an additional $4 would be charged if we ordered it with the dish. Definitely thankful for her suggestion! The sauce was exactly the thing needed to top of the dish. Fish was blackened perfectly, meat was tender and still maintained its fresh-caught flavor.

Our waitress was great as well but we were so well taken care of by the two behind the bar that we felt spoiled. We had a couple dozen raw and char broiled oysters each. The raw oysters were clean, buttery and free of any grit. They paired well with lemon, cocktail sauce or another sauce the young man had made barside. The charbroiled oysters were smokey and buttery and the juices were fabulous! The bread that accompanies them was used with great excitement.

First of all, let's discuss portion and price. We knew we would be eating ALL day long, so we made a point of getting smaller portions at each of the places we visited. 

We started with Eggplant Napoleon - fried eggplant slices in a sauce. This was easily the highlight of our meal. The eggplant and batter had a good flavor, and the sauce was a nice compliment. It would have been nice to wash it down with some tea, but the glasses are juice-sized glasses and you only get one free refill. And for just a shade under $2. WTF?! We sneaked an onion ring from the big guy's brother's plate, and they were good, but there was about 7 of them... so it worked out to about $1 per onion ring. 

We split a shrimp po-boy. For $9.95, we got some tough bread and about 8 pieces of shrimp. No fries added. No hush puppies. Nada. Added to the fact that we waited over 30 minutes between our appetizer and our po-boy. Our first serving of tea was empty about as long. Even the big guy got water, and only got one refill.
